A test case has been enabled in #file:dts-bundler.test.ts that highlights a missing feature in the implementation.

Let's start by going through the failing test case on row 52.

I want help with thinking through the following:

1. Does the test makes sense?
2. Is the expected output in #file:expected.d.ts correct according to the input in #file:input.ts?
3. If the test makes sense and have the correct setup. How would this feature be implemented?

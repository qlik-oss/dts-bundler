A test case has been enabled in `dts-bundler.test.ts` that highlights a missing feature in the implementation.

Let's start by going through the failing test case on row 79.

I want help with thinking through the following:

1. Does the test makes sense?
2. Is the expected output in `expected.d.ts` correct according to the input in `input.ts` in the fixture folder for this test together with any additional settings in either the runTestCase function or a tsconfig.json in the fixture?
3. If the test makes sense and have the correct setup. How would this feature be implemented?

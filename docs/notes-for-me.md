I have enabled a test that is failing and that highlights a bug in the `@qlik/dts-bundler` library. The test can be be found on row 748 in #dts-bundler.test.ts

First I want you to verify that the test makes sense and that the expected output seems correct. Then I want you to analyze the problem and identify how to fix it and put together an implementation plan. Give clear step-by-step instructions on how to implement the fix.

As a reference for the implementation you may look at code in the original bundler that can be found in this vscode workspace `dts-bundle-generator` (/Users/ann/Coding/javascript/dts-bundle-generator)
